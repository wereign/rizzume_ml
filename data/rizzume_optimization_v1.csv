"I started out as a Customer Service Rep 3 and worked my way to a rep 2, and then a Rep 1 before we changed the Rep system to a 1234.
 When doing this we answered customer cals in regards to account balances, transaction review, disputes, wire transfers, statement request,
 Online banking issues, Western Unions, ETC.
 I went to a position in QCD for approximately 3 months.
 Where we revamped QA and turned it into QCD Quality Coaching and Development.
 We each had our own teams that were made of multiple Supervisors and their employees.
 Reviewed cals for performance and compliance to procedures.
 Met with each person on my team monthly and reviewed and coached the agents on cals and met with each Supervisor on each of their
 employees.
 After a short leave of absence I came back and started as a rep 3 and moved to a rep 4 and then to a Lead position.
 Where I had to answer Lead and Supervisor cals, as wel as manage the floor for my Supervisor.
 I then moved to the Outbound team where I was there in the beginning of the team development.
 This was a Pilot program that exceeded the expectations and was opened as a division after the first 3 months instead of the 6 month
 alocated for development.
 We started the division and created the procedures, as we went along.
 This was a Sales position in which we contacted customers with new accounts to ensure they are welcomed to the family, as wel as to fulfil
 their individual financial needs.
 After the first 6 months I was acknowledged by the Board of Directors as a Pilar of Success for the company in Account Retention and
 New Account Acquisition.
 During the first 6 months I was shown to compile 50.4% of the work load for the Outbound team of 5 members.
 I continued to Lead the team in sales for the first implementation of new hires and stayed a top performer until I left the department.
 I then went to the Online Team as a Rep II.
 I currently provide a first line of support for the Online manager.
 I monitor the floor to maintain order and answer any questions if I am the designated Rep II for the day.
 Run credit cards for account funding, assist in account openings if needed, communicate e fectively with the agents on the floor and any
 other interdepartmental interactions, review and log al mailings outgoing, send account denials, review and log the incoming documents,
